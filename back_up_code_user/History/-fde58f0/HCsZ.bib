	abstract = {We engineer the on-site dissipation to reveal its impact on the quantum phase transition from Mott insulator to superfluid. Dissipation is ubiquitous in nature and plays a crucial role in quantum systems such as causing decoherence of quantum states. Recently, much attention has been paid to an intriguing possibility of dissipation as an efficient tool for the preparation and manipulation of quantum states. We report the realization of successful demonstration of a novel role of dissipation in a quantum phase transition using cold atoms. We realize an engineered dissipative Bose-Hubbard system by introducing a controllable strength of two-body inelastic collision via photoassociation for ultracold bosons in a three-dimensional optical lattice. In the dynamics subjected to a slow ramp-down of the optical lattice, we find that strong on-site dissipation favors the Mott insulating state: The melting of the Mott insulator is delayed, and the growth of the phase coherence is suppressed. The controllability of the dissipation is highlighted by quenching the dissipation, providing a novel method for investigating a quantum many-body state and its nonequilibrium dynamics.},

@article{Peng2016,
	abstract = {Exceptional points (EPs) emerge when a system with loss or gain is tuned such that its eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates coalesce. By operating close to two EPs, we achieved a dynamic control of the rotation direction of light in a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonator. This enabled us to tune the emission direction of a WGM microlaser from bidirectional, when the system is away from the EPs, to unidirectional emission at EPs and to reverse the emission direction by moving from one EP to the other. This feature provides WGM resonators new functionalities useful for lasing, sensing, optomechanics, and cavity quantum electrodynamics. Our findings will help to develop novel technologies for controlling the light flow on-chip and could affect scientific fields beyond optics. Controlling the emission and the flow of light in micro- and nanostructures is crucial for on-chip information processing. Here we show how to impose a strong chirality and a switchable direction of light propagation in an optical system by steering it to an exceptional point (EP)?a degeneracy universally occurring in all open physical systems when two eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates coalesce. In our experiments with a fiber-coupled whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonator, we dynamically control the chirality of resonator modes and the emission direction of a WGM microlaser in the vicinity of an EP: Away from the EPs, the resonator modes are nonchiral and laser emission is bidirectional. As the system approaches an EP, the modes become chiral and allow unidirectional emission such that by transiting from one EP to another one the direction of emission can be completely reversed. Our results exemplify a very counterintuitive feature of non-Hermitian physics that paves the way to chiral photonics on a chip.},

@article{Ashida2020,
	abstract = {A review is given on the foundations and applications of non-Hermitian classical and quantum physics. First, key theorems and central concepts in non-Hermitian linear algebra, including Jordan normal form, biorthogonality, exceptional points, pseudo-Hermiticity and parity-time symmetry, are delineated in a pedagogical and mathematically coherent manner. Building on these, we provide an overview of how diverse classical systems, ranging from photonics, mechanics, electrical circuits, acoustics to active matter, can be used to simulate non-Hermitian wave physics. In particular, we discuss rich and unique phenomena found therein, such as unidirectional invisibility, enhanced sensitivity, topological energy transfer, coherent perfect absorption, single-mode lasing, and robust biological transport. We then explain in detail how non-Hermitian operators emerge as an effective description of open quantum systems on the basis of the Feshbach projection approach and the quantum trajectory approach. We discuss their applications to physical systems relevant to a variety of fields, including atomic, molecular and optical physics, mesoscopic physics, and nuclear physics with emphasis on prominent phenomena/subjects in quantum regimes, such as quantum resonances, superradiance, continuous quantum Zeno effect, quantum critical phenomena, Dirac spectra in quantum chromodynamics, and nonunitary conformal field theories. Finally, we introduce the notion of band topology in complex spectra of non-Hermitian systems and present their classifications by providing the proof, firstly given by this review in a complete manner, as well as a number of instructive examples. Other topics related to non-Hermitian physics, including nonreciprocal transport, speed limits, nonunitary quantum walk, are also reviewed.},

While NHSE and its intriguing impact on band topology and dynamics have been observed in classical or photonic systems, their demonstration in a quantum many-body setting remains elusive. Here we report the experimental realization of a dissipative Aharonov-Bohm chain -- a non-Hermitian topological model with NHSE -- in the momentum space of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We identify unique signatures of NHSE in the condensate dynamics, and perform Bragg spectroscopy to resolve topological edge states against a background of localized bulk states. Our work sets the stage for further investigation on the interplay of many-body statistics and interactions with NHSE, and is a significant step forward in the quantum control and simulation of non-Hermitian physics.},

Starting with an operator-based introduction to the quantum field theory of many-body physics, this textbook presents the Feynman diagram approach, Green's functions and finite-temperature many-body physics before developing the path integral approach to interacting systems. Special chapters are devoted to the concepts of Fermi liquid theory, broken symmetry, conduction in disordered systems, superconductivity and the physics of local-moment metals. A strong emphasis on concepts and numerous exercises make this an invaluable course book for graduate students in condensed matter physics. It will also interest students in nuclear, atomic and particle physics.},

	abstract = {Universality classes of non-unitary critical theories in two-dimensions are characterized by the central charge. However, experimental determination of the central charge of a non-unitary critical theory has not been done before because of the intrinsic difficulty that complex parameters usually occur in non-unitary theory, which is not physical. Here we propose to extract the effective central charge of the non-unitary critical point of a two-dimensional lattice model from the quantum coherence measurement of a probe spin which is coupled to the lattice model. A recent discovery shows that quantum coherence of a probe spin which is coupled to a bath is proportional to the partition function of the bath with a complex parameter. Thus the effective central charge of a non-unitary conformal field theory may be extracted from quantum coherence measurement of a probe spin which is coupled to a bath. We have applied the method to the Yang-Lee edge singularity of the two-dimensional Ising model and extracted the effective central charge of the Yang-Lee edge singularity with good precision and tested other predictions of non-unitary conformal field theory. This work paves the way for the first experimental observation of the effective central charge of non-unitary conformal field theory.},

	abstract = {Yang--Lee edge singularities are the branch point of free energy on the complex plane of physical parameters and have been shown to be the simplest universality class of phase transitions. However, Yang--Lee edge singularities have not been regarded as experimentally observable since they occur at complex physical parameters which are unphysical. A recent discovery regarding the relation between partition functions and probe spin coherence makes it experimentally feasible to access the complex plane of physical parameters. However, how to extract the critical point and the critical exponent of Yang--Lee edge singularities in many-body systems, which occurs only at the thermodynamic limit, has still been elusive. Here we show that the quantum coherence of a probe spin coupled to finite-size Ising-type spin systems presents universal scaling behavior near the Yang--Lee edge singularity. The finite-size scaling behavior of the quantum coherence of the probe spin predicts that one can extract the critical point and the critical exponent of the Yang--Lee edge singularity of an Ising-type spin system in the thermodynamic limit from the spin coherence measurement of the probe spin coupled to finite-size Ising-type spin systems. This finding provides a practical approach to studying the nature of Yang--Lee edge singularities of many-body systems.},

The analysis of the data indicates experimental accessibility of the critical exponent µof the Yang-Lee edge singularities. They manifest themselves in divergences of the density functions g(θ), which quantify the distribution of the zeros of the partition function on the Lee-Yang unit circle in the complex plane. In accordance with the hypothesis of universality, a critical exponent close to the theoretical prediction for the two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet, µ= -1/6, is found.},

It also contains several new chapters to cover important recent advances, such as the Fermi gas near unitarity, Dirac fermions, Fermi liquids and their phase transitions, quantum magnetism, and solvable models obtained from string theory. After introducing the basic theory, it moves on to a detailed description of the canonical quantum-critical phase diagram at non-zero temperatures. Finally, a variety of more complex models are explored. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in condensed matter physics and particle and string theory.},

	abstract = {The critical curve with central charge c=-22/5 of the Ising quantum chain in an imaginary longitudinal field is calculated by finite-size extrapolation of the Yang-Lee square root branch point position. Various power laws are found. The field dependence of the off-criticality mass scale and the four lowest off-criticality scaling functions are calculated. The latter turn out to be universal along the critical line and agree very well with the results of the truncated Hilbert space method for the c=-22/5 continuum theory. The author obtains the universal bulk scaling coefficient in qualitative agreement with the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz result. The scattering phaseshift calculated by Luscher's method (1988) reproduces the Cardy-Mussardo minimal solution (1989) for the S-matrix. If a boundary defect is introduced, the only non-trivial primary field decouples, so that the spectrum consists only of the tower of the unit operator. In the antiferromagnetic regime with a non-staggered imaginary field the author finds boundary-dependent lines where the gap vanishes.},

@article{Cai2021,
	abstract = {Behind the flourish of quantum technology [1] is the mature quantum control technique [2, 3], which allows one to manipulate the quantum states of a physical system with unprecedented pre-cisions. The conquests in quantum domain proceed from arbitrary quantum state preparation [4] to arbitrary quantum gates [5, 6], but are mostly limited to closed quantum systems. The ultimate goal of quantum control is to realize arbitrary quantum operations (AQuOs), i.e. the completely-positive-trace-preserving maps [7], for all possible physical processes of an open quantum system. However, the demanding extra physical resources impose obstacles for experiments. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a universal approach of AQuO on a photonic qudit with minimum physical resource of a two-level ancilla and a log 2 d-scale circuit depth for a d-dimensional system [8]. The AQuO is then applied in quantum trajectory simulation for quantum subspace stabilization and quantum Zeno dynamics, arbitrary quantum state preparation, as well as incoherent manipulation of the qudit. Furthermore, the AQuO allows rank-d 2 positive operator-valued measures, which out-perform conventional tomography technique in practice. Therefore, the demonstrated AQuO for complete quantum control would play an indispensable role in quantum information science [9-11]. The ability to manipulate quantum systems lies at the heart of the development of quantum technology. For an ideal isolated quantum system, its quantum state is described by a pure state |ψ, and the universal quantum gate operations can be represented by unitaries |ψ → U |ψ. In the past decades, a main goal of various quantum platforms is to achieve such arbitrary uni-taries [12-15]. For example, it is demonstrated that a gate set including single-qubit unitaries and a two-qubit entangling gate is universal for synthesizing arbitrary quantum circuits [7, 15]. However, isolated quantum system does not exist in practice. On one hand, quantum systems are surrounded by the environment and unavoidably exposed to noise. On the other hand, the control and readout of the quantum systems are necessary for quantum tasks, requiring the communication with external systems. Therefore, practical quantum systems are open and their states should be described by density operators, and physical processes acting on the quantum system are generally described by quantum operations [7] as E (ρ s) = j E j ρ s E † j , where ρ s is the density matrix of the quantum system with d-dimention and E j is Kraus operator (j E † j E j = I d×d with I d×d being the d-dimensional identity matrix). Great attention has already been drawn for realizing arbitrary quantum operations (AQuOs) and universal quantum control of open quantum systems [8, 16, 17]. Although direct control of the interaction between the quantum system and the environment to realize certain open quantum system dynamics has been demonstrated [18, 19], such an analog approach for AQuO is experimentally challenging due to the lack of the capability for arbitrary Hamiltonian engineering. Quantum operations of a d-dimensional system could also be realized digitally by unitary gates acting on a dilated Hilbert space. For example, rank-2 AQuOs are experimentally demonstrated in a trapped-ion system by using a two-dimensional ancilla, and it allows the dissipative quantum state preparation and the simulation of dynamical maps [20, 21]. However, at least m ancillary degrees of freedom are required for simulating the environment and realizing a rank-m quantum operation [7] (m ≤ d 2 , see Methods), imposing tremendous resource overhead. Very recently, Shen et al. theoretically prove an efficient scheme to realize AQuOs with an arbitrary rank by adap-tive control with only one two-dimensional ancilla and a log 2 d-scale circuit depth [8]. Here, we experimentally demonstrate AQuOs on a qu-dit with a dimension d = 4. With the assistance of only one ancilla qubit, we validate the adaptive control scheme [8, 16] through high-fidelity universal unitary gates and real-time feedback control in a superconduct-ing quantum circuit. Based on the AQuOs, we experimentally simulate the quantum trajectory of the qudit, and show the important applications of the AQuOs in subspace stabilization and quantum Zeno effect. Complete quantum control is illustrated by implementing a quantum task, including state preparation, incoherent quantum information processing, and detection through rank-16 symmetric informationally complete (SIC) positive operator-valued measure (POVM). Our results on complete control of quantum systems open up new possibilities in exploring quantum computation, quantum simulation , and quantum metrology.

@article{Lieu2022,
	abstract = {An interesting problem in the field of quantum error correction involves finding a physical system that hosts a "passively-protected quantum memory," defined as an encoded qubit coupled to an environment that naturally wants to correct errors. To date, a quantum memory stable against finite-temperature effects is only known in four spatial dimensions or higher. Here, we take a different approach to realize a stable quantum memory by relying on a driven-dissipative environment. We propose a new model which appears to passively correct against both bit-flip and phase-flip errors in two dimensions: A square lattice composed of photonic "cat qubits" coupled via dissipative terms which tend to fix errors locally. Inspired by the presence of two distinct Z2-symmetry-broken phases, our scheme relies on Ising-like dissipators to protect against bit flips and on a driven-dissipative photonic environment to protect against phase flips. Quantum error correction remains one of the biggest challenges towards building a practical quantum computer [1, 2]. One of the leading candidates for realizing fault tolerance is the family of quantum stabilizer codes [3], including the surface code [4-6] and the GKP code [7]. These error-correcting schemes are based on fast error recovery controlled by the feedback from repetitive syndrome measurements. A prominent alternative is the finite-temperature quantum memory: Certain thermal environments naturally evolve arbitrary initial states into a qubit sub-space of interest at low temperature, thus eliminating the need for active measurements and correcting operations. Many recent studies have investigated thermal self-correcting properties [6, 8-19]. To date, the only known models that host a passive quantum memory via this mechanism are topological codes in four dimensions (4D) and higher, e.g. the 4D toric code [6, 19]. A separate line of research aims to uncover a passively-protected quantum memory via engineered "driven-dissipative" systems [20-39]. Such passive protection includes but is not limited to the finite-temperature case, since a thermal-equilibrium steady state is not required. The quantum memory is dynamically protected against certain noise channels by (local) Markovian dissipation. In this work, we study a model with engineered dissi-pation which appears to protect against both bit flips and phase flips and lives in two spatial dimensions. Instead of relying on topological order, we suggest that the model should belong to a phase that spontaneously breaks two different Z 2 symmetries. Each Z 2-symmetry-broken phase protects a "classical bit," which together † These authors contributed equally. form a robust qubit. Quantum memory.-Consider a Hilbert space H, and define two encoded, logical states | ¯ 0, | ¯ 1 ∈ H that span the codespace C. We assume the system is always ini-tilized in the codespace: ρ i = |ψψ| where |ψ ∈ C. A local continuous-time Markovian generator L in Lindblad form is defined by dρ dt = L(ρ) = −i[H, ρ] + j L j ρL † j − 1 2 \{L † j L j , ρ\} , (1) where H is the Hamiltonian of the system and L j are local dissipators which arise due to the system-environment coupling [40]. We consider a dynamical process that can be decomposed into two parts, an "error" generator and a "recovery" generator: L = L e + L r. The error generator describes the main channels of physical noise which move the initial state out of the codespace. The recovery generator stabilizes the codespace: L r (ρ i) = 0, i.e. any state in the codespace is a steady state of the recovery. We allow for this noisy process to occur for a time t, which generically sends ρ i to a mixed state ρ m (t) = e Lt (ρ i). Finally, we employ a "single-shot" decoding quantum channel E r which sends every state in the Hilbert space back to the codespace [41]. The final state is ρ f (t) = E r e Lt (ρ i). (2) We wish to find systems where the difference between the initial and final states is exponentially small in the system size: 1 − Tr[ρ i ρ f (t)] = O(e −γM) as M → ∞, (3) where γ > 0 is a time-independent constant and M is the linear system size.

@article{Lieu2020,
	abstract = {Symmetry-breaking transitions are a well-understood phenomenon of closed quantum systems in quantum optics, condensed matter, and high energy physics. However, symmetry breaking in open systems is less thoroughly understood, in part due to the richer steady-state and symmetry structure that such systems possess. For the prototypical open system-a Lindbladian-a uni-tary symmetry can be imposed in a "weak" or a "strong" way. We characterize the possible Zn symmetry breaking transitions for both cases. In the case of Z2, a weak-symmetry-broken phase guarantees at most a classical bit steady-state structure, while a strong-symmetry-broken phase admits a partially-protected steady-state qubit. Viewing photonic cat qubits through the lens of strong-symmetry breaking, we show how to dynamically recover the logical information after any gap-preserving strong-symmetric error; such recovery becomes perfect exponentially quickly in the number of photons. Our study forges a connection between driven-dissipative phase transitions and error correction. While an open quantum system typically evolves toward a thermal state [1], non-thermal steady states emerge in the presence of an external drive [2, 3] or via reservoir engineering [4, 5]. In particular, systems with multiple steady states have recently attracted much attention due to their ability to remember initial conditions [6-17]. For Markovian environments, this involves studying Lindblad superoperators (Lindbladians) [18-20] that possess multiple eigenvalues of zero [21]. On the one hand, Lindbladians with such degenerate steady states are the key ingredient for passive error correction [22-33]. In this paradigm, the degenerate steady-state structure of an appropriately engineered Lindbla-dian stores the logical information, and the Lindbladian passively protects this information from certain errors by continuously mapping any leaked information back into the structure without distortion. An important task remains to identify generic systems that host such protected qubit steady-state structures, and classify the errors that can be corrected in this way. On the other hand, the presence of a ground-state de-generacy in the infinite-size limit of a closed system is a salient feature of symmetry breaking (e.g. the ferromag-netic ground states of the Ising model) [34]. While the study of analogous phase transitions in open systems has become a rich and active field [3, 35-48] with significant experimental relevance [49-53], attention has focused on the steady-state degeneracy in symmetry-broken phases only recently [54-56]. Since steady-state degeneracy is a requirement for both passive error correction and symmetry breaking, it is natural to ask whether there are any connections between the two phenomena. Here, we begin to shed light on this interesting and important direction by (A) describing how the dimension and structure of the steady-state manifold changes across a dissipative phase transition, and (B) identifying any passive protection due to the symmetry-broken phase (we will often drop the word symmetry below). To this end, we emphasize an important distinction between "weak" and "strong" transitions which is unique to open systems. This difference stems from the dissipative part of the Lindbladian which can respect a symmetry in two separate ways, as first noted by Bu{\v c}a and Prosen [6]. We show that the Z 2 strong-broken phase encodes a qubit in its steady-state structure in the infinite-size limit, and that errors preserving this structure can be passively corrected. Our analysis is made concrete by considering a driven-dissipative photonic mode-a minimal model for the study of both non-equilibrium transitions [54] and bosonic error-correcting codes [24]. Generic Z n symmetry breaking.-We consider open systems governed by a Lindblad master equation dρ dt = L(ρ) = −i[H, ρ] + i 2L i ρL † i − \{L † i L i , ρ\} , (1) with density matrix ρ, Hamiltonian H, dissipators L i , and Lindbladian L. A strong symmetry is satisfied if there exists an operator P such that [H, P ] = [L i , P ] = 0, ∀i. A weak symmetry is satisfied if [L, P] = 0, where P(·) = P (·)P †. We will showcase differences between previously studied weak-symmetry transitions and the strong-symmetry ones we introduce here, focusing on changes to the dimension and structure of the steady-state manifold. Let us review [54] weak Z 2-symmetry breaking, which is similar to conventional closed-system symmetry breaking and is ubiquitous in open systems [35, 44, 45]. Here, P is a parity operator that satisfies P |$\pm$$\pm$ = $\pm$|$\pm$$\pm$ with},

	abstract = {We analyze surface codes, the topological quantum error-correcting codes introduced by Kitaev. In these codes; qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional array on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately modeled by a three-dimensional Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local, that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing; however, for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum computation with Surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising framework for quantum computing architectures. {\copyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

We develop a mean-field theory to obtain a NH gap equation for order parameters, which are different from the standard BCS ones due to the inequivalence of left and right eigenstates in the NH physics. We find unconventional phase transitions unique to NH systems: superfluidity shows reentrant behavior with increasing dissipation, as a consequence of nondiagonalizable exceptional points, lines, and surfaces in the quasiparticle Hamiltonian for weak attractive interactions. For strong attractive interactions, the superfluid gap never collapses but is enhanced by dissipation due to an interplay between the BCS-BEC crossover and the quantum Zeno effect. Our results lay the groundwork for studies of fermionic superfluidity subject to inelastic collisions.},

@article{Dupuis1998,
	abstract = {We show how Fermi liquid theory results can be systematically recovered using a renormalization group (RG) approach. Considering a two-dimensional system with a circular Fermi surface, we derive RG equations at one-loop order for the two-particle vertex function Γ in the limit of small momentum (Q) and energy (Ω) transfer and obtain the equation which determines the collective modes of a Fermi liquid. The density-density response function is also calculated. The Landau function (or, equivalently, the Landau parameters F s l and F a l) is determined by the fixed point value of the Ω-limit of the two-particle vertex function (Γ Ω *). We show how the results obtained at one-loop order can be extended to all orders in a loop expansion. Calculating the quasi-particle lifetime and renormalization factor at two-loop order, we reproduce the results obtained from two-dimensional bosonization or Ward Identities. We discuss the zero-temperature limit of the RG equations and the difference between the Field Theory and the Kadanoff-Wilson formulations of the RG. We point out the importance of n-body (n ≥ 3) interactions in the latter.},

Because of inelastic collisions and the associated atom losses, this system is described by a complex-valued Kondo interaction and provides a non-Hermitian extension of the Kondo problem. We show that the non-Hermiticity induces anomalous reversion of renormalization-group flows which violate the g theorem due to nonunitarity and produce a quantum phase transition unique to non-Hermiticity. Furthermore, we exactly solve the non-Hermitian Kondo Hamiltonian using a generalized Bethe ansatz method and find the critical line consistent with the renormalization-group flow.},

@article{Shankar1994,
	abstract = {The stability or lack thereof of nonrelativistic fermionic systems to interactions is studied within the renormalization-group (RG) framework, in close analogy with the study of critical phenomena using P scalar field theory. A brief introduction to P" theory in four dimensions and the path-integral formulation for fermions is given before turning to the problem at hand. As for the latter, the following procedure is used. First, the modes on either side of the Fermi surface within a cutoff A are chosen for study, in analogy with the modes near the origin in P" theory, and a path integral is written to describe them. Next, an RG transformation that eliminates a part of these modes, but preserves the action of the noninteracting system, is identified. Finally the possible perturbations of this free-field fixed point are classified as relevant, irrelevant or marginal. A d =1 warmup calculation involving a system of fermions shows how, in contrast to mean-field theory, which predicts a charge-density wave for arbitrarily weak repulsion, and superconductivity for arbitrarily weak attraction, the renormalization-group approach correctly yields a scale-invariant system (Luttinger liquid) by taking into account both instabilities. Application of the re-normalization group in d =2 and 3, for rotationally invariant Fermi surfaces, automatically leads to Landau s Fermi-liquid theory, which appears as a fixed point characterized by an effective mass and a Landau function F, with the only relevant perturbations being of the superconducting (BCS) type. The functional flow equations for the BCS couplings are derived and separated into an infinite number of flows, one for each angular momentum. It is shown that similar results hold for rotationally noninvariant (but time-reversal-invariant) Fermi surfaces also, with obvious loss of rotational invariance in the parametriza-tion of the fixed-point interactions. A study of a nested Fermi surface shows an additional relevant flow leading to charge-density-wave formation. It is pointed out that, for small A/KF, a 1!N expansion emerges, with N =Jr F/A, which explains why one is able to solve the narrow-cutoff theory. The search for non-Fermi liquids in d =2 using the RG is discussed. Bringing a variety of phenomena (Landau theory, charge-density waves, BCS instability, nesting, etc.) under the one unifying principle of the RG not only allows us to better understand and unify them, but also paves the way for generalizations and extensions. The article is pedagogical in nature and is expected to be accessible to any serious graduate student , On the other hand, its survey of the vast literature is mostly limited to the RG approach.

This is not only a problem of open quantum systems but also a problem in closed quantum systems.}}
