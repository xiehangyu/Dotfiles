	abstract = {A quantum gas of ultracold polar molecules, with long-range and anisotropic interactions, not only would enable explorations of a large class of many-body physics phenomena but also could be used for quantum information processing. We report on the creation of an ultracold dense gas of potassium-rubidium (40K87Rb) polar molecules. Using a single step of STIRAP (stimulated Raman adiabatic passage) with two-frequency laser irradiation, we coherently transfer extremely weakly bound KRb molecules to the rovibrational ground state of either the triplet or the singlet electronic ground molecular potential. The polar molecular gas has a peak density of 1012 per cubic centimeter and an expansion-determined translational temperature of 350 nanokelvin. The polar molecules have a permanent electric dipole moment, which we measure with Stark spectroscopy to be 0.052(2) Debye (1 Debye = 3.336 × 10–30 coulomb-meters) for the triplet rovibrational ground state and 0.566(17) Debye for the singlet rovibrational ground state.}}

@book{Wen2007,
	abstract = {{For most of the last century, condensed matter physics has been dominated by band theory and Landau's symmetry breaking theory. In the last twenty years, however, there has been an emergence of a new paradigm associated with fractionalization, emergent gauge bosons and fermions, topological order, string-net condensation, and long range entanglements. These new physical concepts are so fundamental that they may even influence our understanding of the origin of light and electrons in the universe. This book is a pedagogical and systematic introduction to the new concepts and quantum field theoretical methods in condensed matter physics. It discusses many basic notions in theoretical physics which underlie physical phenomena in nature, including a notion that unifies light and electrons. Topics covered include dissipative quantum systems, boson condensation, symmetry breaking and gapless excitations, phase transitions, Fermi liquids, spin density wave states, Fermi and fractional statistics, quantum Hall effects, topological/quantum order, and spin liquid and string-net condensation. Methods discussed include the path integral, Green's functions, mean-field theory, effective theory, renormalization group, bosonization in one- and higher dimensions, non-linear sigma-model, quantum gauge theory, dualities, projective construction, and exactly soluble models beyond one-dimension.}},

@article{Bigagli2023,
	abstract = {Stable ultracold ensembles of dipolar molecules hold great promise for studies of many-body quantum physics, but high inelastic loss rates have been a long-standing challenge. Recently, gases of fermionic molecules in their ground state have been effectively stabilized by applying external fields. However, for gases of bosonic molecules, which might provide access to fundamentally different many-body quantum systems, it is unknown whether a similar suppression of losses can be achieved. This is due to the high inelastic loss rates for bosonic molecules, which are intrinsically one to two orders of magnitude larger than those for their fermionic counterparts. Here we stabilize a bosonic gas of strongly dipolar NaCs molecules via microwave shielding, decreasing losses by more than a factor of 200 and reaching lifetimes on the order of 1 second. In addition, we measure high elastic scattering rates and characterize their anisotropy, which arises from strong dipolar interactions. Finally, we demonstrate evaporative cooling of a bosonic molecular gas. We increase the phase-space density by a factor of 20, reach a temperature of 36(5) nK and bring the system to the brink of quantum degeneracy. Our results constitute a step towards the creation of a Bose--Einstein condensate of dipolar molecules and open the door to the creation of strongly correlated phases of dipolar quantum matter.},

@article{Liu2020,
	abstract = {In many chemical reactions, the transformation from reactants to products is mediated by transient intermediate complexes. For gas-phase reactions involving molecules with a few atoms, these complexes typically live on the order of 10 ps or less before dissociating, and are therefore rarely influenced by external processes. Here, we demonstrate that the transient intermediate complex K2Rb2*, formed from collisions between ultracold KRb molecules, undergoes rapid photo-excitation in the presence of a continuous-wave laser source at 1,064 nm, a wavelength commonly used to confine ultracold molecules. These excitations are facilitated by the exceptionally long lifetime of the complex under ultracold conditions. Indeed, by monitoring the change in the complex population after the sudden removal of the excitation light, we directly measure the lifetime of the complex to be 360 $\pm$30 ns, in agreement with our calculations based on the Rice--Ramsperger--Kassel--Marcus (RRKM) statistical theory. Our results shed light on the origin of the two-body loss widely observed in ultracold molecule experiments. Additionally, the long complex lifetime, coupled with the observed photo-excitation pathway, opens up the possibility to spectroscopically probe the structure of the complex with high resolution, thus elucidating the reaction dynamics.},

@article{Diehl:2008aa,
	abstract = {An open quantum system, the time evolution of which is governed by a master equation, can be driven into a given pure quantum state by an appropriate design of the coupling between the system and the reservoir. This provides a route towards preparing many-body states and non-equilibrium quantum phases by quantum-reservoir engineering. Here, we discuss the example of a driven dissipative Bose--Einstein condensate of bosons and of paired fermions, where atoms in an optical lattice are coupled to a bath of Bogoliubov excitations and the atomic current represents local dissipation. In the absence of interactions, the lattice gas is driven into a pure state with long-range order. Weak interactions lead to a weakly mixed state, which in three dimensions can be understood as a depletion of the condensate, and in one and two dimensions exhibits properties reminiscent of a Luttinger liquid or a Kosterlitz--Thouless critical phase at finite temperature, with the role of the `finite temperature'taken by the interactions.},

@article{Pieczarka:2020aa,
	abstract = {Superfluidity, first discovered in liquid 4He, is closely related to Bose--Einstein condensation (BEC) phenomenon. However, even at zero temperature, a fraction of the quantum liquid is excited out of the condensate into higher momentum states via interaction-induced fluctuations---the phenomenon of quantum depletion. Quantum depletion of atomic BECs in thermal equilibrium is well understood theoretically but is difficult to measure. This measurement is even more challenging in driven-dissipative exciton--polariton condensates, since their non-equilibrium nature is predicted to suppress quantum depletion. Here, we observe quantum depletion of a high-density exciton--polariton condensate by detecting the spectral branch of elementary excitations populated by this process. Analysis of this excitation branch shows that quantum depletion of exciton--polariton condensates can closely follow or strongly deviate from the equilibrium Bogoliubov theory, depending on the exciton fraction in an exciton polariton. Our results reveal beyond mean-field effects of exciton--polariton interactions and call for a deeper understanding of the relationship between equilibrium and non-equilibrium BECs.},

	title = {Dipolar physics: a review of experiments with magnetic quantum gases},
	journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
	abstract = {Since the achievement of quantum degeneracy in gases of chromium atoms in 2004, the experimental investigation of ultracold gases made of highly magnetic atoms has blossomed. The field has yielded the observation of many unprecedented phenomena, in particular those in which long-range and anisotropic dipole–dipole interactions (DDIs) play a crucial role. In this review, we aim to present the aspects of the magnetic quantum-gas platform that make it unique for exploring ultracold and quantum physics as well as to give a thorough overview of experimental achievements. Highly magnetic atoms distinguish themselves by the fact that their electronic ground-state configuration possesses a large electronic total angular momentum. This results in a large magnetic moment and a rich electronic transition spectrum. Such transitions are useful for cooling, trapping, and manipulating these atoms. The complex atomic structure and large dipolar moments of these atoms also lead to a dense spectrum of resonances in their two-body scattering behaviour. These resonances can be used to control the interatomic interactions and, in particular, the relative importance of contact over dipolar interactions. These features provide exquisite control knobs for exploring the few- and many-body physics of dipolar quantum gases. The study of dipolar effects in magnetic quantum gases has covered various few-body phenomena that are based on elastic and inelastic anisotropic scattering. Various many-body effects have also been demonstrated. These affect both the shape, stability, dynamics, and excitations of fully polarised repulsive Bose or Fermi gases. Beyond the mean-field instability, strong dipolar interactions competing with slightly weaker contact interactions between magnetic bosons yield new quantum-stabilised states, among which are self-bound droplets, droplet assemblies, and supersolids. Dipolar interactions also deeply affect the physics of atomic gases with an internal degree of freedom as these interactions intrinsically couple spin and atomic motion. Finally, long-range dipolar interactions can stabilise strongly correlated excited states of 1D gases and also impact the physics of lattice-confined systems, both at the spin-polarised level (Hubbard models with off-site interactions) and at the spinful level (XYZ models). In the present manuscript, we aim to provide an extensive overview of the various related experimental achievements up to the present.}

	abstract = {We engineer the on-site dissipation to reveal its impact on the quantum phase transition from Mott insulator to superfluid. Dissipation is ubiquitous in nature and plays a crucial role in quantum systems such as causing decoherence of quantum states. Recently, much attention has been paid to an intriguing possibility of dissipation as an efficient tool for the preparation and manipulation of quantum states. We report the realization of successful demonstration of a novel role of dissipation in a quantum phase transition using cold atoms. We realize an engineered dissipative Bose-Hubbard system by introducing a controllable strength of two-body inelastic collision via photoassociation for ultracold bosons in a three-dimensional optical lattice. In the dynamics subjected to a slow ramp-down of the optical lattice, we find that strong on-site dissipation favors the Mott insulating state: The melting of the Mott insulator is delayed, and the growth of the phase coherence is suppressed. The controllability of the dissipation is highlighted by quenching the dissipation, providing a novel method for investigating a quantum many-body state and its nonequilibrium dynamics.},

	abstract = { Exploring and controlling inelastic and reactive collisions on the quantum level is a main goal of the developing field of ultracold chemistry. For this, the preparation of precisely defined initial atomic and molecular states in tailored environments is necessary. Here we present experimental studies of inelastic collisions of metastable ultracold Rb 2 molecules in an array of quasi-1D potential tubes. In particular, we investigate collisions of molecules in the absolute lowest triplet energy level where any inelastic process requires a change of the electronic state. Remarkably, we find similar decay rates as for collisions between rotationally or vibrationally excited triplet molecules where other decay paths are also available. The decay rates are close to the ones for universal reactions but vary considerably when confinement and collision energy are changed. This might be exploited to control the collisional properties of molecules. },

	abstract = { Each semigroup describing time evolution of an open quantum system on a finite dimensional Hilbert space is related to a special structure of this space. It is shown how the space can be decomposed into orthogonal subspaces: One part is related to decay, some subspaces of the other subspace are ranges of the stationary states. Specialities are highlighted where the complete positivity of evolutions is actually needed for analysis, mainly for evolution of coherence. Decompositions are done the same way for discrete as for continuous time evolutions, but they may show differences: Only for discrete semigroups there may appear cases of sudden decay and of perpetual oscillation. Concluding the analysis, we identify the relation of the state space structure to the processes of decay, decoherence, dissipation and dephasing. },

	abstract = {{This book treats the central physical concepts and mathematical techniques used to investigate the dynamics of open quantum systems. To provide a self-contained presentation, the text begins with a survey of classical probability theory and with an introduction to the foundations of quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on its statistical interpretation and on the formulation of generalized measurement theory through quantum operations and effects. The fundamentals of density matrix theory, quantum Markov processes, and completely positive dynamical semigroups are developed. The most important master equations used in quantum optics and condensed matter theory are derived and applied to the study of many examples. Special attention is paid to the Markovian and non-Markovian theory of environment induced decoherence, its role in the dynamical description of the measurement process, and to the experimental observation of decohering electromagnetic field states. The book includes the modern formulation of open quantum systems in terms of stochastic processes in Hilbert space. Stochastic wave function methods and Monte Carlo algorithms are designed and applied to important examples from quantum optics and atomic physics. The fundamentals of the treatment of non-Markovian quantum processes in open systems are developed on the basis of various mathematical techniques, such as projection superoperator methods and influence functional techniques. In addition, the book expounds the relativistic theory of quantum measurements and the density matrix theory of relativistic quantum electrodynamics.}},

They share in common   that coherent and driven--dissipative quantum dynamics occur on an equal footing, creating genuine   non-equilibrium scenarios without immediate counterpart in equilibrium condensed matter physics. T  his concerns both their non-thermal stationary states and their many-body time evolution. It is a   challenge to theory to identify novel instances of universal emergent macroscopic phenomena, which   are tied unambiguously and in an observable way to the microscopic drive conditions. In this revi  ew, we discuss some recent results in this direction. Moreover, we provide a systematic introducti  on to the open system Keldysh functional integral approach, which is the proper technical tool to   accomplish a merger of quantum optics and many-body physics, and leverages the power of modern qua  ntum field theory to driven open quantum systems.},
