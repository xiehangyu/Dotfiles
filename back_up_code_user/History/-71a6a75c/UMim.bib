  abstract      = {We present a new variational method for investigating the
		  ground state and out of equilibrium dynamics of quantum
		  many-body bosonic and fermionic systems. Our approach is
		  based on constructing variational wavefunctions which
		  extend Gaussian states by including generalized canonical
		  transformations between the fields. The key advantage of
		  such states compared to simple Gaussian states is presence
		  of non-factorizable correlations and the possibility of
		  describing states with strong entanglement between
		  particles. In contrast to the commonly used canonical
		  transformations, such as the polaron or Lang–Firsov
		  transformations, we allow parameters of the transformations
		  to be time dependent, which extends their regions of
		  applicability. We derive equations of motion for the
		  parameters characterizing the states both in real and
		  imaginary time using the differential structure of the
		  variational manifold. The ground state can be found by
		  following the imaginary time evolution until it converges
		  to a steady state. Collective excitations in the system can
		  be obtained by linearizing the real-time equations of
		  motion in the vicinity of the imaginary time steady-state
		  solution. Our formalism allows us not only to determine the
		  energy spectrum of quasiparticles and their lifetime, but
		  to obtain the complete spectral functions and to explore
		  far out of equilibrium dynamics such as coherent evolution
		  following a quantum quench. We illustrate and benchmark
		  this framework with several examples: a single polaron in
		  the Holstein and Su–Schrieffer–Heeger models,
		  non-equilibrium dynamics in the spin-boson and Kondo
		  models, the superconducting to charge density wave phase
		  transitions in the Holstein model.}

		  within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered
		  phases, and phase transitions among them, that are

		  renaissance era after the experimental realization [1] of
		  cold atomic systems that can evolve out of equilibrium in
		  the absence of any dissipation and with high degree of
		  tunability of Hamiltonian parameters. A strongly limiting
		  factor for a better understanding of these phenomena is the
		  absence of effective numerical methods to simulate the
		  dynamics of quantum systems. For methods like time
		  dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) [2]
		  this lack of efficiency has been traced back [3] to a too
		  fast increasing of the entanglement en-tropy between parts
		  of the whole system and the impossibility for a classical
		  computer to store and manipulate such large amount of
		  quantum information. This observation partially moved the
		  interest from the study of local observables to the
		  understanding of the evolution of the entanglement entropy
		  and in particular to its growth with time [5, 6]. Based on
		  early results from conformal field theory [6, 7] and on
		  exact/numerical ones for simple solvable model [6, 8] it is
		  widely accepted [3] that the entanglement entropy grows
		  linearly with time for a so called global quench (i.e. when
		  the initial state differs globally from the ground state
		  and the excess of energy is extensive), while at most
		  logarithmically for a local one (i.e. when the the initial
		  state has only a local difference with the ground state and
		  so a little excess of energy). As a consequence a local
		  quench is simulable by means of tDMRG, while a global one
		  is not. However, despite this fundamental interest and a
		  large effort of the community, still analytic results are
		  lacking. In this letter we fill this gap providing the
		  analytic expression of the entanglement entropy at any time
		  in the limit of a large block for the XY chain in a
		  transverse magnetic field described by the Hamiltonian H(h,
		  γ) = − N j=1 1 + γ 4 σ x j σ x j+1 + 1 − γ 4 σ y
		  j σ y j+1 + h 2 σ z j , (1) where σ α j are the Pauli
		  matrices at the site j. Periodic boundary conditions are
		  always imposed. In spite of its simplicity, the model shows
		  a rich phase diagram being critical for h = 1 and any γ
		  and for γ = 0 and |h| ≤ 1, with the two critical lines
		  belonging to different univer-sality classes. The block
		  entanglement entropy is defined as the Von Neumann entropy
		  S ℓ = −Trρ ℓ log ρ ℓ , where ρ ℓ = Tr n≥ℓ
		  ρ is the reduced density matrix of the block formed by ℓ

  abstract      = {We present exact results on a novel kind of emergent
		  random matrix universality that quantum many-body systems
		  at infinite temperature can exhibit. Specifically, we
		  consider an ensemble of pure states supported on a small
		  subsystem, generated from projective measurements of the
		  remainder of the system in a local basis. We rigorously
		  show that the ensemble, derived for a class of quantum
		  chaotic systems undergoing quench dynamics, approaches a
		  universal form completely independent of system details: it
		  becomes uniformly distributed in Hilbert space. This goes
		  beyond the standard paradigm of quantum thermalization,
		  which dictates that the subsystem relaxes to an ensemble of
		  quantum states that reproduces the expectation values of
		  local observables in a thermal mixed state. Our results
		  imply more generally that the distribution of quantum
		  states themselves becomes indistinguishable from those of
		  uniformly random ones, i.e., the ensemble forms a quantum
		  state design in the parlance of quantum information theory.
		  Our work establishes bridges between quantum many-body
		  physics, quantum information and random matrix theory, by

@Article{	  kaneko2020,
  abstract      = {Complexity of dynamics is at the core of quantum many-body

		  ergodicity in thermalization processes is a manifestation
		  of the lowest-order complexity, which is represented by the
		  eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) stating that
		  individual energy eigenstates are thermal. Here, we propose
		  a higher-order generalization of the ETH, named the k-ETH
		  (k=1,2), to quantify higher-order complexity of quantum
		  many-body dynamics at the level of individual energy
		  eigenstates, where the lowest-order ETH (1-ETH) is the

		  contribution of the higher-order ETH, we show that the

		  while, as is well known, the volume law can be accounted

  abstract      = {Thermalizing quantum systems are conventionally described
		  by statistical mechanics at equilibrium. However, not all
		  systems fall into this category, with many-body
		  localization providing a generic mechanism for
		  thermalization to fail in strongly disordered systems.
		  Many-body localized (MBL) systems remain perfect insulators
		  at nonzero temperature, which do not thermalize and
		  therefore cannot be described using statistical mechanics.
		  This Colloquium reviews recent theoretical and experimental
		  advances in studies of MBL systems, focusing on the new
		  perspective provided by entanglement and nonequilibrium
		  experimental probes such as quantum quenches.
		  Theoretically, MBL systems exhibit a new kind of robust
		  integrability: an extensive set of quasilocal integrals of
		  motion emerges, which provides an intuitive explanation of
		  the breakdown of thermalization. A description based on
		  quasilocal integrals of motion is used to predict dynamical
		  properties of MBL systems, such as the spreading of quantum
		  entanglement, the behavior of local observables, and the
		  response to external dissipative processes. Furthermore,
		  MBL systems can exhibit eigenstate transitions and quantum
		  orders forbidden in thermodynamic equilibrium. An outline
		  is given of the current theoretical understanding of the
		  quantum-to-classical transition between many-body localized
		  and ergodic phases and anomalous transport in the vicinity
		  of that transition. Experimentally, synthetic quantum
		  systems, which are well isolated from an external thermal
		  reservoir, provide natural platforms for realizing the MBL
		  phase. Recent experiments with ultracold atoms, trapped
		  ions, superconducting qubits, and quantum materials, in
		  which different signatures of many-body localization have
		  been observed, are reviewed. This Colloquium concludes by

		  entanglement entropy of typical pure quantum states in
		  which the number of particles is not fixed and derive
		  results for the volume-law entanglement entropy of typical
		  pure quantum states with a fixed number of particles. For
		  definiteness, we consider lattice systems of fermions in an
		  arbitrary dimension and present results for averages over
		  all states as well as over the subset of all Gaussian
		  states. For quantum states in which the number of particles
		  is not fixed, the results for the average over all states
		  are well known since the work of Page, who found that in
		  the thermodynamic limit the leading term follows a volume

		  corresponding results for Gaussian states are more recent.
		  The leading term is still a volume law, but it is not
		  maximal and depends on the ratio between the volumes of the
		  subsystem and the entire system. Moreover, the variance is
		  independent of the system size, i.e., the average also
		  gives the typical entanglement entropy. We prove that while

		  volume-law term in the average entanglement entropy, it can
		  fundamentally change the nature of the subleading terms. In
		  particular, subleading corrections appear that depend on
		  the square root of the volume. We unveil the origin of

  abstract      = {The modern description of elementary particles, as
		  formulated in the standard model of particle physics, is
		  built on gauge theories1. Gauge theories implement
		  fundamental laws of physics by local symmetry constraints.
		  For example, in quantum electrodynamics Gauss’s law
		  introduces an intrinsic local relation between charged
		  matter and electromagnetic fields, which protects many
		  salient physical properties, including massless photons and
		  a long-ranged Coulomb law. Solving gauge theories using
		  classical computers is an extremely arduous task2, which
		  has stimulated an effort to simulate gauge-theory dynamics
		  in microscopically engineered quantum devices3–6.
		  Previous achievements implemented density-dependent Peierls
		  phases without defining a local symmetry7,8, realized
		  mappings onto effective models to integrate out either
		  matter or electric fields9–12, or were limited to very
		  small systems13–16. However, the essential gauge symmetry
		  has not been observed experimentally. Here we report the
		  quantum simulation of an extended U(1) lattice gauge
		  theory, and experimentally quantify the gauge invariance in
		  a many-body system comprising matter and gauge fields.
		  These fields are realized in defect-free arrays of bosonic
		  atoms in an optical superlattice of 71 sites. We
		  demonstrate full tunability of the model parameters and
		  benchmark the matter–gauge interactions by sweeping
		  across a quantum phase transition. Using high-fidelity
		  manipulation techniques, we measure the degree to which
		  Gauss’s law is violated by extracting probabilities of
		  locally gauge-invariant states from correlated atom
		  occupations. Our work provides a way to explore gauge
		  symmetry in the interplay of fundamental particles using
		  controllable large-scale quantum simulators.},

		  higher the temperature, the more a system is removed from
		  its lowest energy state. Things become more complicated in
		  a nonequilibrium system governed by quantum mechanics and

		  showed that as many as 10 temperature-like parameters are

		  The description of the non-equilibrium dynamics of isolated
		  quantum many-body systems within the framework of
		  statistical mechanics is a fundamental open question.
		  Conventional thermodynamical ensembles fail to describe the
		  large class of systems that exhibit nontrivial conserved

		  study of correlation functions up to 10th order. The
		  applicability of the generalized ensemble description for

		  non-equilibrium quantum systems provides crucial
		  information about the structure of the time-dependent
		  state. For quantum quench protocols, by combining a
		  quasiparticle picture for the entanglement spreading with
		  the exact knowledge of the stationary state provided by
		  Bethe ansatz, it is possible to obtain an exact and
		  analytic description of the evolution of the entanglement
		  entropy. Here we discuss the application of these ideas to
		  several integrable models. First we show that for
		  non-interacting systems, both bosonic and fermionic, the
		  exact time-dependence of the entanglement entropy can be
		  derived by elementary techniques and without solving the
		  dynamics. We then provide exact results for interacting
		  spin chains that are carefully tested against numerical
		  simulations. Finally, we apply this method to integrable
		  one-dimensional Bose gases (Lieb-Liniger model) both in the
		  attractive and repulsive regimes. We highlight a peculiar
		  behaviour of the entanglement entropy due to the absence of
		  a maximum velocity of excitations.</p>},

  abstract      = {We introduce and discuss known results for the volume-law
		  entanglement entropy of typical pure quantum states in
		  which the number of particles is not fixed and derive
		  results for the volume-law entanglement entropy of typical
		  pure quantum states with a fixed number of particles. For
		  definiteness, we consider lattice systems of fermions in an
		  arbitrary dimension and present results for averages over
		  all states as well as over the subset of all Gaussian
		  states. For quantum states in which the number of particles
		  is not fixed, the results for the average over all states
		  are well known since the work of Page, who found that in
		  the thermodynamic limit the leading term follows a volume
		  law and is maximal. The associated variance vanishes
		  exponentially fast with increasing system size, i.e., the
		  average is also the typical entanglement entropy. The
		  corresponding results for Gaussian states are more recent.
		  The leading term is still a volume law, but it is not
		  maximal and depends on the ratio between the volumes of the
		  subsystem and the entire system. Moreover, the variance is
		  independent of the system size, i.e., the average also
		  gives the typical entanglement entropy. We prove that while
		  fixing the number of particles in pure quantum states does
		  not qualitatively change the behavior of the leading
		  volume-law term in the average entanglement entropy, it can
		  fundamentally change the nature of the subleading terms. In
		  particular, subleading corrections appear that depend on
		  the square root of the volume. We unveil the origin of
		  those corrections. Finally, we discuss the connection
		  between the entanglement entropy of typical pure states and
		  recent analytical results obtained in the context of random
		  matrix theory, as well as numerical results obtained for
