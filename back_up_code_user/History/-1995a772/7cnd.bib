abstract = {We present a new variational method for investigating the ground state and out of equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body bosonic and fermionic systems. Our approach is based on constructing variational wavefunctions which extend Gaussian states by including generalized canonical transformations between the fields. The key advantage of such states compared to simple Gaussian states is presence of non-factorizable correlations and the possibility of describing states with strong entanglement between particles. In contrast to the commonly used canonical transformations, such as the polaron or Lang–Firsov transformations, we allow parameters of the transformations to be time dependent, which extends their regions of applicability. We derive equations of motion for the parameters characterizing the states both in real and imaginary time using the differential structure of the variational manifold. The ground state can be found by following the imaginary time evolution until it converges to a steady state. Collective excitations in the system can be obtained by linearizing the real-time equations of motion in the vicinity of the imaginary time steady-state solution. Our formalism allows us not only to determine the energy spectrum of quasiparticles and their lifetime, but to obtain the complete spectral functions and to explore far out of equilibrium dynamics such as coherent evolution following a quantum quench. We illustrate and benchmark this framework with several examples: a single polaron in the Holstein and Su–Schrieffer–Heeger models, non-equilibrium dynamics in the spin-boson and Kondo models, the superconducting to charge density wave phase transitions in the Holstein model.}

abstract = {Notions of a Gaussian state and a Gaussian linear map are generalized to the case of anticommuting (Grassmann) variables. Conditions under which a Gaussian map is trace preserving and (or) completely positive are formulated. For any Gaussian map an explicit formula relating correlation matrices of input and output states is presented. This formalism allows to develop the Lagrangian representation for fermionic linear optics (FLO). It covers both unitary operations and the single-mode projectors associated with FLO measurements. Using the Lagrangian representation we reduce a classical simulation of FLO to a computation of Gaussian integrals over Grassmann variables. Explicit formulas describing evolution of a quantum state under FLO operations are put forward.},

abstract = { We review some recent developments in the statistical mechanics of isolated quantum systems. We provide a brief introduction to quantum thermalization, paying particular attention to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and the resulting single-eigenstate statistical mechanics. We then focus on a class of systems that fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson-localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics. These systems can forever locally remember information about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden. }

This is defined as the von Neumann entropy SA = −Tr ρAlogρA corresponding to the reduced density matrix ρA of a subsystem A. For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result of Holzhey et al when A is a finite interval of length in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems, finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length ξ is large but finite, we show that , where is the number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition.}

Our approach extends the framework of classical shadows, a randomized approach to learning a collection of quantum-state properties, to the fermionic setting. Our sampling protocol uses randomized measurement settings generated by a discrete group of fermionic Gaussian unitaries, implementable with linear-depth circuits. We prove that estimating all k-RDM elements to additive precision requires on the order of (nk)k3/2log(n)/ 2 repeated state preparations, which is optimal up to the logarithmic factor. Furthermore, numerical calculations show that our protocol offers a substantial improvement in constant overheads for k≥2, as compared to prior deterministic strategies. We also adapt our method to particle-number symmetry, wherein the additional circuit depth may be halved at the cost of roughly 2-5 times more repetitions.},

Moreover, we show that our methods can also be applied to compute the complexity of excited energy eigenstates of the free Dirac field.

Notably, our scheme only requires local operations and measurements after generating an entangled probe using the quantum network. In addition, we find a tolerable photon-loss rate that maintains the quantum enhancement. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that even when CV quantum networks are composed of local beam splitters, the quantum enhancement can be attained when the depth is sufficiently large.},

@article{relation_entropy_Phase,
   abstract = {Physical interactions in quantum many-body systems are typically local: Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: the entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such "area laws" for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium the current status of area laws in these fields is reviewed. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation in quantum lattice models, and disordered systems, nonequilibrium situations, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. These questions are considered in classical and quantum systems, in their ground and thermal states, for a variety of correlation measures.

Matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogs, and variational sets from entanglement renormalization are also discussed and the paper is concluded by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations of quantum states. © 2010 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Statistical mechanics is founded on the assumption that all accessible configurations of a system are equally likely. This requires dynamics that explore all states over time, known as ergodic dynamics. In isolated quantum systems, however, the occurrence of ergodic behavior has remained an outstanding question. Here, we demonstrate ergodic dynamics in a small quantum system consisting of only three superconducting qubits. The qubits undergo a sequence of rotations and interactions and we measure the evolution of the density matrix. Maps of the entanglement entropy show that the full system can act like a reservoir for individual qubits, increasing their entropy through entanglement. Surprisingly, these maps bear a strong resemblance to the phase space dynamics in the classical limit; classically chaotic motion coincides with higher entanglement entropy. We further show that in regions of high entropy the full multi-qubit system undergoes ergodic dynamics. Our work illustrates how controllable quantum systems can investigate fundamental questions in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.},

It describes non-local correlations between quantum objects, and is at the heart of quantum information sciences. Entanglement is now being studied in diverse fields ranging from condensed matter to quantum gravity. However, measuring entanglement remains a challenge. This is especially so in systems of interacting delocalized particles, for which a direct experimental measurement of spatial entanglement has been elusive. Here, we measure entanglement in such a system of itinerant particles using quantum interference of many-body twins. Making use of our single-site-resolved control of ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices, we prepare two identical copies of a many-body state and interfere them. This enables us to directly measure quantum purity, Rényi entanglement entropy, and mutual information. These experiments pave the way for using entanglement to characterize quantum phases and dynamics of strongly correlated many-body systems.},

Our study is carried out focusing on a system of non-interacting fermions on the lattice. We study the time evolution of the entanglement entropy showing that the standard semiclassical formula is not applicable. We propose a suitable generalisation which correctly describes the entanglement entropy evolution and perfectly matches numerical data.

With experiments accessing the intricate dynamics of many-body quantum systems, it is paramount to develop powerful methods that encode the emergent physics. Up to now, the strong dichotomy observed between integrable and non-integrable evolutions made an overarching theory difficult to build, especially for transport phenomena where space-time profiles are drastically different. We present a novel framework for studying transport in integrable systems: hydrodynamics with infinitely-many conservation laws. This bridges the conceptual gap between integrable and non-integrable quantum dynamics, and gives powerful tools for accurate studies of space-time profiles.

We focus on the protocol where two semi-infinite halves are initially prepared in different states and then joined together, showing that a proper generalisation of the quasiparticle picture leads to exact quantitative predictions. If the system is initially prepared in a quasistationary state, we find that the entanglement entropy is additive and it can be computed by means of generalised hydrodynamics. Conversely, additivity is lost when the initial state is not quasistationary; yet the entanglement entropy in the large-scale limit can be exactly predicted in the quasiparticle picture, provided that the initial state is low entangled.},

   abstract = {The non-equilibrium evolution of the block entanglement entropy is investigated in the XY chain in a transverse magnetic field after the Hamiltonian parameters are suddenly changed from and to arbitrary values. Using Toeplitz matrix representation and multidimensional phase methods, we provide analytic results for large blocks and for all times, showing explicitly the linear growth in time followed by saturation. The consequences of these analytic results are discussed and the effects of a finite block length is taken into account numerically. The non-equilibrium evolution of extended quantum systems is one of the most challenging problems of contemporary research in theoretical physics. The subject is in a renaissance era after the experimental realization [1] of cold atomic systems that can evolve out of equilibrium in the absence of any dissipation and with high degree of tunability of Hamiltonian parameters. A strongly limiting factor for a better understanding of these phenomena is the absence of effective numerical methods to simulate the dynamics of quantum systems. For methods like time dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) [2] this lack of efficiency has been traced back [3] to a too fast increasing of the entanglement en-tropy between parts of the whole system and the impossibility for a classical computer to store and manipulate such large amount of quantum information. This observation partially moved the interest from the study of local observables to the understanding of the evolution of the entanglement entropy and in particular to its growth with time [5, 6]. Based on early results from conformal field theory [6, 7] and on exact/numerical ones for simple solvable model [6, 8] it is widely accepted [3] that the entanglement entropy grows linearly with time for a so called global quench (i.e. when the initial state differs globally from the ground state and the excess of energy is extensive), while at most logarithmically for a local one (i.e. when the the initial state has only a local difference with the ground state and so a little excess of energy). As a consequence a local quench is simulable by means of tDMRG, while a global one is not. However, despite this fundamental interest and a large effort of the community, still analytic results are lacking. In this letter we fill this gap providing the analytic expression of the entanglement entropy at any time in the limit of a large block for the XY chain in a transverse magnetic field described by the Hamiltonian H(h, γ) = − N j=1 1 + γ 4 σ x j σ x j+1 + 1 − γ 4 σ y j σ y j+1 + h 2 σ z j , (1) where σ α j are the Pauli matrices at the site j. Periodic boundary conditions are always imposed. In spite of its simplicity, the model shows a rich phase diagram being critical for h = 1 and any γ and for γ = 0 and |h| ≤ 1, with the two critical lines belonging to different univer-sality classes. The block entanglement entropy is defined as the Von Neumann entropy S ℓ = −Trρ ℓ log ρ ℓ , where ρ ℓ = Tr n≥ℓ ρ is the reduced density matrix of the block formed by ℓ contiguous spins. In the following we will consider the quench with parameters suddenly changed at time t = 0 from h 0 , γ 0 to h, γ. Our main result is that, in the thermodynamic limit N → ∞ and subsequently in the limit of a large block ℓ ≫ 1, the time dependence of S ℓ (t) can be written as an integral over the momentum variable ϕ S ℓ (t) = t 2|ǫ ′ |t<ℓ dϕ 2π 2|ǫ ′ |H(cos ∆ ϕ)+ ℓ 2|ǫ ′ |t>ℓ dϕ 2π H(cos ∆ ϕ) , (2) where ǫ ′ = dǫ/dϕ is the derivative of the dispersion relation ǫ 2 = (h − cos ϕ) 2 + γ 2 sin 2 ϕ and represents the momentum dependent sound velocity (that because of locality has a maximum we indicate as v M ≡ max ϕ |ǫ ′ |), cos ∆ ϕ = (hh 0 − cos ϕ(h + h 0) + cos 2 ϕ + γγ 0 sin 2 ϕ)/ǫǫ 0 contains all the quench information [9] and H(x) = −[(1 + x)/2 log(1 + x)/2 + (1 − x)/2 log(1 − x)/2].

Here we discuss the application of these ideas to several integrable models. First we show that for non-interacting systems, both bosonic and fermionic, the exact time-dependence of the entanglement entropy can be derived by elementary techniques and without solving the dynamics. We then provide exact results for interacting spin chains that are carefully tested against numerical simulations. Finally, we apply this method to integrable one-dimensional Bose gases (Lieb-Liniger model) both in the attractive and repulsive regimes.

Specifically, we consider an ensemble of pure states supported on a small subsystem, generated from projective measurements of the remainder of the system in a local basis. We rigorously show that the ensemble, derived for a class of quantum chaotic systems undergoing quench dynamics, approaches a universal form completely independent of system details: it becomes uniformly distributed in Hilbert space. This goes beyond the standard paradigm of quantum thermalization, which dictates that the subsystem relaxes to an ensemble of quantum states that reproduces the expectation values of local observables in a thermal mixed state. Our results imply more generally that the distribution of quantum states themselves becomes indistinguishable from those of uniformly random ones, i.e., the ensemble forms a quantum state design in the parlance of quantum information theory. Our work establishes bridges between quantum many-body physics, quantum information and random matrix theory, by showing that pseudorandom states can arise from isolated quantum dynamics, opening up new ways to design applications for quantum state tomography and benchmarking.},

These correlations are quantified by parameters that are subject to the "concentration of measure" phenomenon, meaning that on a large-probability set these parameters are close to their expectation. For the entropy of entanglement, this has the counterintuitive consequence that there exist large subspaces in which all pure states are close to maximally entangled. This, in turn, implies the existence of mixed states with entanglement of formation near that of a maximally entangled state, but with negligible quantum mutual information and, therefore, negligible distillable entanglement, secret key, and common randomness. It also implies a very strong locking effect for the entanglement of formation: its value can jump from maximal to near zero by tracing over a number of qubits negligible compared to the size of the total system. Furthermore, such properties are generic. Similar phenomena are observed for random multiparty states, leading us to speculate on the possibility that the theory of entanglement is much simplified when restricted to asymptotically generic states. Further consequences of our results include a complete derandomization of the protocol for universal superdense coding of quantum states.},

   abstract = {We study the fluctuations of subsystem entropies in closed quantum many-body systems after thermalization. Using a combination of analytics and numerics for both random quantum circuits and Hamiltonian dynamics, we find that the statistics of such entropy fluctuations is drastically different than in the classical setting. For instance, shortly after a system thermalizes, the probability of entropy fluctuations for a subregion is suppressed in the dimension of the Hilbert space of the complementary subregion. This suppression becomes increasingly stringent as a function of time, ultimately depending on the exponential of the Hilbert space dimension, until extremely late times when the amount of suppression saturates. We also use our results to estimate the total number of rare fluctuations at large timescales. We find that the "Boltzmann brain"paradox is largely ameliorated in quantum many-body systems, in contrast with the classical setting.},

   abstract = {We study how useful random states are for quantum metrology, i.e., whether they surpass the classical limits imposed on precision in the canonical phase sensing scenario. First, we prove that random pure states drawn from the Hilbert space of distinguishable particles typically do not lead to superclassical scaling of precision even when allowing for local unitary optimization. Conversely, we show that random pure states from the symmetric subspace typically achieve the optimal Heisenberg scaling without the need for local unitary optimization. Surprisingly, the Heisenberg scaling is observed for random isospectral states of arbitrarily low purity, preserved under loss of a fixed number of particles. Moreover, we prove that for pure states, a standard photon-counting interferometric measurement suffices to typically achieve resolution following the Heisenberg scaling for all values of the phase at the same time. Finally, we demonstrate that metrologically useful states can be prepared with short random optical circuits generated from three types of beam splitters, a single nonlinear (Kerr-like) transformation.},

   abstract = {Complexity of dynamics is at the core of quantum many-body chaos and exhibits a hierarchical feature: higher-order complexity implies more chaotic dynamics. Conventional ergodicity in thermalization processes is a manifestation of the lowest-order complexity, which is represented by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) stating that individual energy eigenstates are thermal. Here, we propose a higher-order generalization of the ETH, named the k-ETH (k=1,2), to quantify higher-order complexity of quantum many-body dynamics at the level of individual energy eigenstates, where the lowest-order ETH (1-ETH) is the conventional ETH. The explicit condition of the k-ETH is obtained by comparing Hamiltonian dynamics with the Haar random unitary of the k-fold channel. As a nontrivial contribution of the higher-order ETH, we show that the k-ETH with k≥2 implies a universal behavior of the kth Rényi entanglement entropy of individual energy eigenstates. In particular, the Page correction of the entanglement entropy originates from the higher-order ETH, while, as is well known, the volume law can be accounted for by the 1-ETH. We numerically verify that the 2-ETH approximately holds for a nonintegrable system, but does not hold in the integrable case. To further investigate the information-theoretic feature behind the k-ETH, we introduce a concept named a partial unitary k-design (PU k-design), which is an approximation of the Haar random unitary up to the kth moment, where "partial" means that only a limited number of observables are accessible. The k-ETH is a special case of a PU k-design for the ensemble of Hamiltonian dynamics with random-time sampling. In addition, we discuss the relationship between the higher-order ETH and information scrambling quantified by out-of-time-ordered correlators. Our framework provides a unified view on thermalization, entanglement entropy, and unitary k-designs, leading to deeper characterization of higher-order quantum complexity.},

   abstract = {Thermalizing quantum systems are conventionally described by statistical mechanics at equilibrium. However, not all systems fall into this category, with many-body localization providing a generic mechanism for thermalization to fail in strongly disordered systems. Many-body localized (MBL) systems remain perfect insulators at nonzero temperature, which do not thermalize and therefore cannot be described using statistical mechanics. This Colloquium reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in studies of MBL systems, focusing on the new perspective provided by entanglement and nonequilibrium experimental probes such as quantum quenches. Theoretically, MBL systems exhibit a new kind of robust integrability: an extensive set of quasilocal integrals of motion emerges, which provides an intuitive explanation of the breakdown of thermalization. A description based on quasilocal integrals of motion is used to predict dynamical properties of MBL systems, such as the spreading of quantum entanglement, the behavior of local observables, and the response to external dissipative processes. Furthermore, MBL systems can exhibit eigenstate transitions and quantum orders forbidden in thermodynamic equilibrium. An outline is given of the current theoretical understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition between many-body localized and ergodic phases and anomalous transport in the vicinity of that transition. Experimentally, synthetic quantum systems, which are well isolated from an external thermal reservoir, provide natural platforms for realizing the MBL phase. Recent experiments with ultracold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, and quantum materials, in which different signatures of many-body localization have been observed, are reviewed. This Colloquium concludes by listing outstanding challenges and promising future research directions.},

We prove that a generalized version of the strong ETH holds for noninteracting integrable systems with translation invariance. Our generalized ETH states that any pair of energy eigenstates with similar values of local conserved quantities looks similar with respect to local observables, such as local correlations. This result tells us that an integrable system relaxes to a GGE for any initial state that has subextensive fluctuations of macroscopic local conserved quantities.

One of the hallmarks of topological materials is the existence of protected gapless surface states, which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bulk wave functions. This review provides a pedagogical introduction into the field of topological quantum matter with an emphasis on classification schemes. Both fully gapped and gapless topological materials and their classification in terms of nonspatial symmetries, such as time reversal, as well as spatial symmetries, such as reflection, are considered. Furthermore, the classification of gapless modes localized on topological defects is surveyed. The classification of these systems is discussed by use of homotopy groups, Clifford algebras, K theory, and nonlinear sigma models describing the Anderson (de)localization at the surface or inside a defect of the material. Theoretical model systems and their topological invariants are reviewed together with recent experimental results in order to provide a unified and comprehensive perspective of the field. While the bulk of this article is concerned with the topological properties of noninteracting or mean-field Hamiltonians, a brief overview of recent results and open questions concerning the topological classifications of interacting systems is also provided.},

PACS numbers: 05.30.Ch, 02.90. +p, 03.65.-w, 05.90.+m Very recently Page [1] considered the problem of getting entropy out of a system in a pure quantum state. He took a quantum system AB of Hilbert dimension mn with normalized density matrix, and divided it into two coupled subsystems, A and B, of dimension m and n, respectively, with rn & n Suppose the system AB is in a pure state; then its entropy S~s = D. However, the entropy of the subsystems S~ and Ss are positive. Page and several other authors, as cited in his Letter, were interested in S ", the average of the entropy S~ over all pure states of the total system. The pure states were assumed to have the unitarily invariant Haar measure on the space of unit vectors [Q) in the rnn-dimensional Hilbert space of the total system. Page conjectured an elegant formula for Sm, "based on its form for rn = 2, 3, 4, and 5. He also obtained an approximate formula valid for large rn and n, starting from the equivalent of the following exact formula, S, "= (S~) =-N(rn, n)) p, lnp, P(pt,. .. , p) dp, , where m m m P(p» "p) dp =d(&-) p) [ (N-p,) (pa dpi) i=1 i=1 1&i&a&m A:=1 (2) which differs from that of Page by the normalization factor N(rn, n) = 4 h ~ i=1 (3) We shall assume these formulas and proceed to prove the conjecture by evaluating the integrals exactly. Because of limitation of space, the details [2] will be published elsewhere. To begin, the integrand is multiplied by a damping factor exp(-P,. t etp,) which serves two advantages: (1) the p, in the products Q may be replaced by D, =-~s and (2) if the delta function is expressed as an integral, the order of integration can be interchanged such that the integrations over p, are done first.

   abstract = {If a black hole starts in a pure quantum state and evaporates completely by a unitary process, the von Neumann entropy of the Hawking radiation initially increases and then decreases back to zero when the black hole has disappeared. Here numerical results are given for an approximation to the time dependence of the radiation entropy under an assumption of fast scrambling, for large nonrotating black holes that emit essentially only photons and gravitons. The maximum of the von Neumann entropy then occurs after about 53.81% of the evaporation time, when the black hole has lost about 40.25% of its original Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy (an upper bound for its von Neumann entropy) and then has a BH entropy that equals the entropy in the radiation, which is about 59.75% of the original BH entropy 4 pi M_0^2, or about 7.509 M_0^2 \approx 6.268 x 10^\{76\}(M_0/M_sun)^2, using my 1976 calculations that the photon and graviton emission process into empty space gives about 1.4847 times the BH entropy loss of the black hole. Results are also given for black holes in initially impure states. If the black hole starts in a maximally mixed state, the von Neumann entropy of the Hawking radiation increases from zero up to a maximum of about 119.51% of the original BH entropy, or about 15.018 M_0^2 \approx 1.254 x 10^\{77\}(M_0/M_sun)^2, and then decreases back down to 4 pi M_0^2 = 1.049 x 10^\{77\}(M_0/M_sun)^2.},

@article{Hawking1976,
   abstract = {The principle of equivalence, which says that gravity couples to the energy-momentum tensor of matter, and the quantum-mechanical requirement that energy should be positive imply that gravity is always attractive. This leads to singularities in any reasonable theory of gravitation. A singularity is a place where the classical concepts of space and time break down as do all the known laws of physics because they are all formulated on a classical space-time background. In this paper it is claimed that this breakdown is not merely a result of our ignorance of the correct theory but that it represents a fundamental limitation to our ability to predict the future, a limitation that is analogous but additional to the limitation imposed by the normal quantum-mechanical uncertainty principle. The new limitation arises because general relativity allows the causal structure of space-time to be very different from that of Minkowski space. The interaction region can be bounded not only by an initial surface on which data are given and a final surface on which measurements are made but also a "hidden surface" about which the observer has only limited information such as the mass, angular momentum, and charge. Concerning this hidden surface one has a "principle of ignorance": The surface emits with equal probability all configurations of particles-compatible with the observers limited knowledge. It is shown that the ignorance principle holds for the quantum-mechanical evaporation of black holes: The black hole creates particles in pairs, with one particle always falling into the hole and the other possibly escaping to infinity. Because part of the information about the state of the system is lost down the hole, the final situation is represented by a density matrix rather than a pure quantum state. This means there is no S matrix for the process of black-hole formation and evaporation. Instead one has to introduce a new operator, called the superscattering operator, which maps density matrices describing the initial situation to density matrices describing the final situation.},

@article{Vidmar2017,
   abstract = {In a seminal paper [D. N. Page, Phys. Rev. Lett. 71, 1291 (1993)], Page proved that the average entanglement entropy of subsystems of random pure states is Save ln DA − (1/2)D 2 A /D for 1 DA ≤ √ D, where DA and D are the Hilbert space dimensions of the subsystem and the system, respectively. Hence, typical pure states are (nearly) maximally entangled. We develop tools to compute the average entanglement entropy S of all eigenstates of quadratic fermionic Hamilto-nians. In particular, we derive exact bounds for the most general translationally invariant models ln DA − (ln DA) 2 / ln D ≤ ≤S ≤ ln DA − [1/(2 ln 2)](ln DA) 2 / ln D. Consequently we prove that: (i) if the subsystem size is a finite fraction of the system size then S < ln DA in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., the average over eigenstates of the Hamiltonian departs from the result for typical pure states, and (ii) in the limit in which the subsystem size is a vanishing fraction of the system size, the average entanglement entropy is maximal, i.e., typical eigenstates of such Hamiltonians exhibit eigenstate thermalization. Introduction. The concept of entanglement is a cornerstone in modern quantum physics. Different measures of entanglement have been extensively used to probe the structure of pure quantum states [1], and they have started to be measured in experiments with ultracold atoms in optical lattices [2, 3]. Here, we are interested in the bipartite entanglement entropy (referred to as the entanglement entropy) in fermionic lattice systems. In such systems, an upper bound for the entanglement en-tropy of a subsystem A (smaller or equal than its complement) is S max = ln D A , where D and D A (D A ≤ √ D) are the dimensions of the Hilbert space of the system and of the subsystem (see Fig. 1 for an example for spin-less fermions). Note that ln D A ∝ V A , where V A is the number of sites in A, i.e., this upper bound scales with the "volume" of A. (When A is larger than its complement , the Hilbert space of the complement is the one that determines S.) Almost 24 years ago, motivated by the puzzle of information in black hole radiation [4], Page proved [5] that typical (with respect to the Haar measure) pure states nearly saturate that bound [6-10]. Their reduced density matrices are thermal at infinite temperature [11-13]. In stark contrast with typical pure states, ground states and low-lying excited states of local Hamiltoni-ans are known to exhibit an area-law entanglement [1]. Namely, their entanglement entropy scales with the area of the boundary of the subsystem. On the other hand, most eigenstates of local Hamiltonians at nonzero energy densities above the ground state are expected to have a volume-law entanglement entropy (with the exception of many-body localized systems [14, 15]). Within the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [16-18], one expects volume-law entanglement in all eigenstates (ex-cluding those at the edges of the spectrum) of quantum chaotic Hamiltonians [19-23], with those in the center of the spectrum exhibiting maximal entanglement [23]. Thanks to the availability of powerful analytical and computational tools to study ground states, many remarkable results have been obtained for the entanglement},

Focusing on systems in classes BDI and D, we find crossings in single-particle entanglement spectra for quantum quenches between different symmetry-protected topological phases. The entanglement-spectrum crossings are shown to be stable against symmetry-preserving disorder and faithfully reflect both Z (class BDI) and Z2 (class D) topological characterizations. As a by-product, we unravel the topological origin of the global degeneracies temporarily emerging in the many-body entanglement spectrum in the quench dynamics of the transverse-field Ising model. These findings can experimentally be tested in ultracold atoms and trapped ions with the help of cutting-edge tomography for quantum many-body states.

We then investigate the simulatability of phase-random states, which is directly related to that of time evolution in closed systems, by studying their entanglement properties. We find that, starting from a separable state, time evolutions under Hamiltonians composed of only separable eigenstates generate extremely high entanglement and are difficult to simulate with matrix-product states.

Here, to explore microscopic dynamics of generating quantum pseudorandomness in many-body systems, we provide new efficient constructions of unitary designs and propose a design Hamiltonian, a random Hamiltonian of which dynamics always forms a unitary design after a threshold time. The new constructions are based on the alternate applications of random potentials in the generalized position and momentum spaces, and we provide explicit quantum circuits generating quantum pseudorandomness significantly more efficient than previous ones. We then provide a design Hamiltonian in disordered systems with periodically changing spin-glass-type interactions. The design Hamiltonian generates quantum pseudorandomness in a constant time even in the system composed of a large number of spins.

   abstract = {In a quantum system in a pure state, a subsystem generally has a nonzero entropy because of entanglement with the rest of the system. Is the average entanglement entropy of pure states also the typical entropy of the subsystem? We present a method to compute the exact formula of the momenta of the probability P(SA)dSA that a subsystem has entanglement entropy SA. The method applies to subsystems defined by a subalgebra of observables with a center. In the case of a trivial center, we reobtain the well-known result for the average entropy and the formula for the variance. In the presence of a nontrivial center, the Hilbert space does not have a tensor product structure and the well-known formula does not apply. We present the exact formula for the average entanglement entropy and its variance in the presence of a center. We show that for large systems the variance is small, ΔSA/SA1, and therefore the average entanglement entropy is typical. We compare exact and numerical results for the probability distribution and comment on the relation to previous results on concentration of measure bounds. We discuss the application to physical systems where a center arises. In particular, for a system of noninteracting spins in a magnetic field and for a free quantum field, we show how the thermal entropy arises as the typical entanglement entropy of energy eigenstates.},

It has recently been shown that the Hermitised product XM X2X1AXT 1XT 2 XTM , where each Xi is a standard real Gaussian matrix and A is real anti-symmetric, exhibits analogous properties. Here we use the theory of spherical functions and transforms to present a theory which, for even dimensions, includes these properties of the latter product as a special case. As an example we show that the theory also allows for a treatment of this class of Hermitised product when the Xi are chosen as sub-blocks of Haar distributed real orthogonal matrices.},

   abstract = {The entanglement properties of random pure states are relevant to a variety of problems ranging from chaotic quantum dynamics to black-hole physics. The averaged bipartite entanglement entropy of such states admits a volume law and upon increasing the subregion size follows the Page curve. In this paper, we generalize this setup to random mixed states by coupling the system to a bath and use the partial transpose to study their entanglement properties. We develop a diagrammatic method to incorporate partial transpose within random matrix theory and formulate a perturbation theory in 1/L, the inverse of the Hilbert-space dimension. We compute several quantities including the spectral density of partial transpose (or entanglement negativity spectrum), two-point correlator of eigenvalues, and the logarithmic negativity. As long as the bath is smaller than the system, we find that upon sweeping the subregion size, the logarithmic negativity shows an initial increase and a final decrease similar to the Page curve, while it admits a plateau in the intermediate regime where the logarithmic negativity depends only on the size of the system and of the bath but not on how the system is partitioned. This intermediate phase has no analog in random pure states, and is separated from the two other regimes by a critical point. We further show that when the bath is larger than the system by at least two extra qubits the logarithmic negativity is identically zero, which implies that there is no distillable entanglement. Using the diagrammatic approach, we provide a simple derivation of the semicircle law of the entanglement negativity spectrum in the latter two regimes. We show that despite the appearance of a semicircle distribution, reminiscent of Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), the higher-order corrections to the negativity spectrum and two-point correlator deviate from those of GUE.},

We apply these methods to the study of (A) entanglement and complexity, (B) dynamics of stable systems, (C) dynamics of driven systems. From this, we compile a comprehensive list of mathematical structures and formulas to compare bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states side-by-side. },

Using recent results from random matrix theory, we show that the average entanglement entropy of pure random fermionic Gaussian states in a subsystem of NA out of N degrees of freedom is given by (SA)G=(N-12)ψ(2N)+(14-NA)ψ(N)+(12+NA-N)ψ(2N-2NA)-14ψ(N-NA)-NA, where ψ is the digamma function.

Remarkably, its leading order agrees with the average over eigenstates of random quadratic Hamiltonians with number conservation, as found by Łydżba, Rigol, and Vidmar.

If the evaporation of the black hole has already proceeded past the ''half-way'' point, where half of the initial entropy has been radiated away, then additional quantum information deposited in the black hole is revealed in the Hawking radiation very rapidly. Information deposited prior to the half-way point remains concealed until the half-way point, and then emerges quickly. These conclusions hold because typical local quantum circuits are efficient encoders for quantum error-correcting codes that nearly achieve the capacity of the quantum erasure channel.

This counterintuitive idea which has its roots in the nonextensive nature of black-hole entropy serves as a guiding principle in the search for the fundamental laws of Planck-scale physics. In this paper we show that a similar phenomenon emerges from the established laws of classical and quantum physics: the information contained in part of a system in thermal equilibrium obeys an area law. While the maximal information per unit area depends classically only on the number of microscopic degrees of freedom, it may diverge as the inverse temperature in quantum systems. A rigorous relation between area laws and correlations is established and their explicit behavior is revealed for a large class of quantum many-body states beyond equilibrium systems.},

   abstract = {Thermalization and scrambling are the subject of much recent study from the perspective of many-body quantum systems with locally bounded Hilbert spaces ("spin chains"), quantum field theory, and holography. We tackle this problem in 1D spin chains evolving under random local unitary circuits and prove a number of exact results on the behavior of out-of-time-ordered commutators (OTOCs) and entanglement growth in this setting. These results follow from the observation that the spreading of operators in random circuits is described by a "hydrodynamical" equation of motion, despite the fact that random unitary circuits do not have locally conserved quantities (e.g., no conserved energy). In this hydrodynamic picture, quantum information travels in a front with a "butterfly velocity" vB that is smaller than the light-cone velocity of the system, while the front itself broadens diffusively in time. The OTOC increases sharply after the arrival of the light cone, but we do not observe a prolonged exponential regime of the form ∼eλL(t-x/v) for a fixed Lyapunov exponent λL. We find that the diffusive broadening of the front has important consequences for entanglement growth, leading to an entanglement velocity that can be significantly smaller than the butterfly velocity. We conjecture that the hydrodynamical description applies to more generic Floquet ergodic systems, and we support this idea by verifying numerically that the diffusive broadening of the operator wavefront also holds in a more traditional nonrandom Floquet spin chain. We also compare our results to Clifford circuits, which have less rich hydrodynamics and consequently trivial OTOC behavior, but which can nevertheless exhibit linear entanglement growth and thermalization.},

   abstract = {We introduce and discuss known results for the volume-law entanglement entropy of typical pure quantum states in which the number of particles is not fixed and derive results for the volume-law entanglement entropy of typical pure quantum states with a fixed number of particles. For definiteness, we consider lattice systems of fermions in an arbitrary dimension and present results for averages over all states as well as over the subset of all Gaussian states. For quantum states in which the number of particles is not fixed, the results for the average over all states are well known since the work of Page, who found that in the thermodynamic limit the leading term follows a volume law and is maximal. The associated variance vanishes exponentially fast with increasing system size, i.e., the average is also the typical entanglement entropy. The corresponding results for Gaussian states are more recent. The leading term is still a volume law, but it is not maximal and depends on the ratio between the volumes of the subsystem and the entire system. Moreover, the variance is independent of the system size, i.e., the average also gives the typical entanglement entropy. We prove that while fixing the number of particles in pure quantum states does not qualitatively change the behavior of the leading volume-law term in the average entanglement entropy, it can fundamentally change the nature of the subleading terms. In particular, subleading corrections appear that depend on the square root of the volume. We unveil the origin of those corrections. Finally, we discuss the connection between the entanglement entropy of typical pure states and recent analytical results obtained in the context of random matrix theory, as well as numerical results obtained for physical Hamiltonians.},

   abstract = {The modern description of elementary particles, as formulated in the standard model of particle physics, is built on gauge theories1. Gauge theories implement fundamental laws of physics by local symmetry constraints. For example, in quantum electrodynamics Gauss’s law introduces an intrinsic local relation between charged matter and electromagnetic fields, which protects many salient physical properties, including massless photons and a long-ranged Coulomb law. Solving gauge theories using classical computers is an extremely arduous task2, which has stimulated an effort to simulate gauge-theory dynamics in microscopically engineered quantum devices3–6. Previous achievements implemented density-dependent Peierls phases without defining a local symmetry7,8, realized mappings onto effective models to integrate out either matter or electric fields9–12, or were limited to very small systems13–16. However, the essential gauge symmetry has not been observed experimentally. Here we report the quantum simulation of an extended U(1) lattice gauge theory, and experimentally quantify the gauge invariance in a many-body system comprising matter and gauge fields. These fields are realized in defect-free arrays of bosonic atoms in an optical superlattice of 71 sites. We demonstrate full tunability of the model parameters and benchmark the matter–gauge interactions by sweeping across a quantum phase transition. Using high-fidelity manipulation techniques, we measure the degree to which Gauss’s law is violated by extracting probabilities of locally gauge-invariant states from correlated atom occupations. Our work provides a way to explore gauge symmetry in the interplay of fundamental particles using controllable large-scale quantum simulators.},

   abstract = {Ring exchange is an elementary interaction for modeling unconventional topological matters which hold promise for efficient quantum information processing. We report the observation of four-body ring-exchange interactions and the topological properties of anyonic excitations within an ultracold atom system. A minimum toric code Hamiltonian in which the ring exchange is the dominant term, was implemented by engineering a Hubbard Hamiltonian that describes atomic spins in disconnected plaquette arrays formed by two orthogonal superlattices. The ring-exchange interactions were resolved from the dynamical evolutions in the spin orders, matching well with the predicted energy gaps between two anyonic excitations of the spin system. A braiding operation was applied to the spins in the plaquettes and an induced phase $1.00(3)\pi$ in the four-spin state was observed, confirming $\frac\{1\}\{2\}$-anynoic statistics. This work represents an essential step towards studying topological matters with many-body systems and the applications in quantum computation and simulation.},

	journal = {J. Stat. Mech.},
	abstract = {In the majority of analytical verifications of the conjecture that the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) describes the large time asymptotics of local observables in quantum quench problems, both post- and pre-quench Hamiltonians are essentially noninteracting. We test this conjecture studying field correlations in the more general case of an arbitrary pre-quench Hamiltonian, while keeping the post-quench one noninteracting. We first show that, in the previously studied special case of a noninteracting pre-quench Hamiltonian, the validity of the conjecture is a consequence of Wick’s theorem. We then show that this conjecture is more generally valid for an arbitrary interacting pre-quench Hamiltonian, but this time as a consequence of the cluster decomposition property of the initial state, which is a fundamental principle for generic physical states. For arbitrary initial states that do not satisfy the cluster decomposition property, the above conjecture is not generally true. As a byproduct of our investigation we obtain an analytical derivation of earlier numerical results for the large time evolution of correlations after a quantum quench of the interaction in the Lieb–Liniger model from a nonzero value to zero.}

@article{ETH_CT_proof1,
   abstract = {<p>If the evaporation of a black hole formed from a pure state is unitary, the entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation should follow the Page curve, increasing from zero until near the halfway point of the evaporation, and then decreasing back to zero. The general argument for the Page curve is based on the assumption that the quantum state of the black hole plus radiation during the evaporation process is typical. In this paper, we show that the Page curve can result from a simple dynamical input in the evolution of the black hole, based on a recently proposed signature of quantum chaos, without resorting to typicality. Our argument is based on what we refer to as the “operator gas” approach, which allows one to understand the evolution of the microstate of the black hole from generic features of the Heisenberg evolution of operators. One key feature which leads to the Page curve is the possibility of dynamical processes where operators in the “gas” can “jump” outside the black hole, which we refer to as void formation processes. Such processes are initially exponentially suppressed, but dominate after a certain time scale, which can be used as a dynamical definition of the Page time. In the Hayden-Preskill protocol for young and old black holes, we show that void formation is also responsible for the transfer of information from the black hole to the radiation. We conjecture that void formation may provide a microscopic explanation for the recent semi-classical prescription of including islands in the calculation of the entanglement entropy of the radiation.</p>},

Matrix quantum mechanics (systems whose degrees of freedom are n by n matrices) saturate the bound.

Black holes are the fastest scramblers in nature.

abstract = {Most people have an intuitive understanding of temperature. In the context of statistical mechanics, the higher the temperature, the more a system is removed from its lowest energy state. Things become more complicated in a nonequilibrium system governed by quantum mechanics and constrained by several conserved quantities. Langen et al. showed that as many as 10 temperature-like parameters are necessary to describe the steady state of a one-dimensional gas of Rb atoms that was split into two in a particular way (see the Perspective by Spielman). Science, this issue p. 207; see also p. 185 Interferometry suggests that as many as 10 parameters are needed to describe the steady state of an integrable system. [Also see Perspective by Spielman] The description of the non-equilibrium dynamics of isolated quantum many-body systems within the framework of statistical mechanics is a fundamental open question. Conventional thermodynamical ensembles fail to describe the large class of systems that exhibit nontrivial conserved quantities, and generalized ensembles have been predicted to maximize entropy in these systems. We show experimentally that a degenerate one-dimensional Bose gas relaxes to a state that can be described by such a generalized ensemble. This is verified through a detailed study of correlation functions up to 10th order. The applicability of the generalized ensemble description for isolated quantum many-body systems points to a natural emergence of classical statistical properties from the microscopic unitary quantum evolution.}}
